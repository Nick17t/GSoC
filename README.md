##🔎 Who are we

[Jina AI](jina.ai) is an open source software company behind couples of open-source projets, including:

- [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina): Data type agnostic Python library for effortless processing and manipulation of data. A single data structure for all kinds of data.

- [Docarray](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray): A cloud-native neural search framework to build SOTA and scalable deep learning search applications in minutes.

- [Finetuner](https://github.com/jina-ai/finetuner): Finetune any deep neural network for better embedding on neural search tasks

Our goal is to build a [neural search](https://docs.jina.ai/get-started/neural-search/) ecosystem to help developers build neural search applications in just minutes. This will enable developers to turn unstructured data into actionable insights, easily and quickly.

## What You Will Get

We strive to be helpful and welcoming to new open source contributors. We hope that we can help give the participants a strong foundation of contributing to open-source artificial intelligence and neural search and learn best engineering practices through their GSoC tenure with us.

All the mentors are from our own engineering team. They will mentor and review the mentee’s deliverables in detail, with timely communication and tracking of projects’ progress, ensuring a very enriching internship experience.

You can expect to

- learn how to work in an open source project.
- learn how to build a neural search system with the SOTA models.
- learn best practices in writing codes.
- get credits from GSoC.
- get awesome SWAGS.

## 📝 How to Apply

### *Project 1: Context-Aware Landmark Search*
 
Landmark retrieval is a hot topic in both academic resarch and industrial applications. Given a Image-to-Image search system, we input an image contains a tourist Landmark and expect to retrieve photos of the same Landmark sites. However, most of the job has been done to optimize the accuracy of the search results, ratther than the "usefulness" of the search results. This application expect you to train a machine learning model care beyond accuracy. For instance, given a photo of the Great Wall, you get Great Wall photos and re-rank them by different seasonal images (e.g. summer scene, snow scene etc..). Finally, you incorporate your model and build a tourist Landmark search system with Jina.

#### 👨‍🏫️ Mentors

### *Project X: Interested in proposing a new project idea altogether?*

We are always excited to hear from the community about potential projects and features Jina could host. If you are excited about any idea and would like to
propose it as a GSoC project, get in touch with our mentors and we'd be very happy to be inclusive.
