## üîé Who are we?

<p align="center">
<b>
Welcome to the GSoC projects page of Jina AI! 
</b>
</p>
Jina AI provides a powerful platform for building neural-search<sup><a href="https://docs.jina.ai/get-started/neural-search/">?</a></sup>, generative AI services with cloud-native technology, and we are thrilled to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) this year. Our goal is to provide students with opportunities to work on real-world, cutting-edge projects and contribute to the growth of our community.

We are firm supporters of open source and have open sourced multiple projects, including:

- [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) is a MLOps framework that empowers anyone to build multimodal AI services via cloud native technologies. It uplifts a local PoC into a production-ready service. Jina handles the infrastructure complexity, making advanced solution engineering and cloud-native technologies accessible to every developer.
- [DocArray](https://github.com/jina-ai/docarray) is a library for nested, unstructured, multimodal data in transit, including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc. It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process, embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer multimodal data with a Pythonic API.

We are always enthusiastic about GSoC and we believe this experience will help us empower more users, improve open source and overall, enhance developer experience.

### *Project idea 1: DocArray wrap ANN libraries*

| Info | details |
|---------------|---------------|
| Skills needed    | Python, ANN Search experience                                |
| Project size     | 175 hours                                                    |
| Difficulty level | Medium                                                       |
| Mentors          | @[Johannes](https://github.com/JohannesMessner), @[Sami Jaghouar](https://github.com/samsja) |

#### Project Description

- In DocArray, we have been concentrating on developing production-ready Vector DBs for large-scale searches. However, there are many ANN libraries without scalability layers that can be integrated into DocArray, making it accessible to academia and production teams with small-to-medium amounts of data, without the need for external services.

#### Expected outcomes
- We have a set of DocStores implementations in DocArray that support the most popular ANN libraries, such as FAISS, Annoy, and Hnswlib.



### *Project idea 2: Make ANNLite the go-to Vector Search library to be scaled by Jina using the StatefulExecutor feature*

| info | details |
|---------------|---------------|
| Skills needed    | ANN, C++, Python, Databases                                  |
| Project size     | 350 hours                                                    |
| Difficulty level | Hard                                                         |
| Mentors          | @[Felix Wang](https://github.com/numb3r3) @[Joan Mart√≠nez](https://github.com/JoanFM) |

#### Project Description

- Jina is developing a stateful executor feature that enables Deployments with a state to be replicated and scaled. This opens the door to having a Vector Database in our ecosystem effectively and robustly. Iterating on ANNLite to act as the "Lucene" for Jina would be a great opportunity.

#### Expected outcomes
- Prove and come up with an Executor in our Hub that uses ANNlite or DocArray with ANNLite as a backend to be the default Vector Databases for all our examples for mid-sized data requirements.



### *Project idea 3: Research about deploying LLM with Jina*

| info             | details                                                      |

| Difficulty level | Hard                                                         |
| Mentors          | @[Alaeddine Abdessalem](https://github.com/alaeddine-13), @[Joan Mart√≠nez](https://github.com/JoanFM) |

#### Project Description

- Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention for their ability to generate text to solve various tasks, such as question-answering, reading comprehension, and coding. However, most of these models are quite large, and deploying them requires certain technologies to be in place to enable scalability when using GPU resources. We aim to assess the capability of deploying such models with Jina and explore what integrations we can build with the existing ecosystem to enable LLM inference using the Jina stack.

#### Expected outcomes
- Jina is ready to be used to deploy and scale LLM to build Generative applications in a cost-efficient manner



### *Project idea 4: Build Executor (model) UI in jina*

| info             | details                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skills needed    | Python                                                   |
| Project size     | 175 hours                                                |
| Difficulty level | Easy                                                     |
| Mentors          | @[Alaeddine Abdessalem](https://github.com/alaeddine-13) |

#### Project Description

- Jina Executors are components that perform certain tasks and expose them as services using gRPC. Executors accept DocumentArrays as input and output. However, with DocArray v2 focusing on type annotations and enabling annotation of executor endpoints, it becomes possible for executors to describe their services and input/output in the same way as OpenAPI schemas. This allows us to offer built-in UIs for executors, enabling people to easily use their services with multi-modal data. The goal is to build this feature in Jina using Gradio.

#### Expected outcomes
- Submit one or more Pull Requests (PRs) to the Jina repository that enables providing a built-in Executor UI for Executors. The UI can be built using Gradio and should be able to infer information about the Executor service using type annotations.




### *Project idea 5:  Expand ANNLite capabilities with BM25 to build Hybrid Search*

| info             | details                                                      |

| Difficulty level | Hard                                                         |

#### Project Description

- In relation to #3 project, another interesting approach would be to incorporate BM25 and Hybrid Search into ANNLite, which would enable Jina to build scalable Hybrid Search solutions in the cloud with a powerful default solution.

#### Expected outcomes
- ANNLite is ready to be used as a default library to solve Hybrid Search applications.



### *Project idea 6:  JAX support in DocArray v2*

| info             | details                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Skills needed    | Python, C++, Lucene, ANN, Inverted Index    |
| Project size     | 350 hours                                   |
| Difficulty level | Hard                                        |
| Mentors          | @[Sami Jaghouar](https://github.com/samsja) |

#### Project Description

- DocArray is a library for representing, sending, and storing multi-modal data, with a focus on applications in ML and Neural Search. It currently supports several deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow. Jax is becoming increasingly popular for deep learning, so we want to integrate it into DocArray.

- The project we propose is to add Jax as a backend for DocArray, alongside PyTorch and TensorFlow. The first part would involve rewriting and translating all of the computational backend functions of DocArray with the Jax framework. Then, we would battle-test the implementation against a real Jax use case, such as integrating DocArray with Jax support for model training and serving.

#### Expected outcomes

- We aim to provide JAX with the same level of support in DocArray as we do for pytorch, numpy, and tensorflow. The integration should be thoroughly tested and documented.

#### Desired skills

- Python proficiency is expected since the DocArray codebase is quite complete. Additionally, experience with the JAX framework and familiarity with the scientific Python ecosystem (e.g. NumPy, Torch, scikit-learn, etc.) is required.
