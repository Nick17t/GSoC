## üí° Project Ideas

### *Project idea 1- Accurate landmark search system*

| Involves | Jina |
| --- | --- |
| Skills needed | Python, Javascript, Unit Testing, Architecture design, Machine Learning|
| Project size | Large |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| Mentors | |

#### Project description

Landmark retrieval is a hot topic in both academic research and industrial applications. We realise the importance of landmark retrieval rising up again post COVID. As the tourist places open again, we can expect an increase in the number of queries tackled related to landmark search. 

The project aims to create an Image-to-Image search system, wherein we input an image containing a tourist landmark and expect to retrieve photos of the same landmark sites but taken at different times in a year. However, most of the job has been done to optimise the accuracy of the search results, rather than the "usefulness" of the search results. 

This application expects you to train a machine learning model and create a faceted search system. The model will be trained to recognize not only the similar images but also, rank them on the basis of months in a year. The faceted search will enable users to apply for filters and manipulate search according to their use cases.

For instance, given a photo of the Great Wall of China, the system renders Great Wall photos and re-ranks them by different seasonal images (e.g. summer scene, snow scene etc..). 

Finally, the trained model will be put to use in building a tourist Landmark search system with Jina. An additional task would be to showcase the tag of ‚Äúsafe to visit‚Äù or ‚Äúunsafe to visit‚Äù in the pandemic.
 
#### Getting started:
Please introduce yourself in #introductions channel in our slack channel and learn about Jina by reading the [documentation](https://docs.jina.ai/). 

#### üéØ Desired Outcomes


### *Project idea 2- Jina AI playground*

| Involves | Jina |
| --- | --- |
| Skills needed | Javascript, Python, Compiler design, Testing, HTML, CSS |
| Project size | Large |
| Difficulty | Hard |
| Mentors | |

#### Project description

Jina‚Äôs documentation contains a lot of examples ranging from normal vector search to multimodal searches. External developers wanting to explore neural search and wanting to see how the code correlates to the output, might want to experience some examples hands-on. 

We are already in the process of building a helpful community where developers can find their doubts cleared easily but we get a lot of questions about runtime errors because of varied environments. To mitigate this and show the users how Jina works and produces results, we propose to create an IDE integrated playground for Jina where the dummy code can be seen in action.

This project will combine Jina‚Äôs backend and external frontend frameworks to create a playground where developers will be able to see the source code and the output it renders. 

#### Getting started:
Please introduce yourself in `#introductions` channel in our slack channel and learn about Jina by reading the [documentation](https://docs.jina.ai/). 


### *Project idea 3- Data visualisation in the browser using DocArray*

| Involves | Jina |
| --- | --- |
| Skills needed | Javascript, Python, Compiler design, Testing, HTML, CSS |
| Project size | Large |
| Difficulty | Hard |
| Mentors | |

#### Project description

Data visualisation helps lay a better foundation for data interpretation. Data engineers require data visualisation the most and efforts have been made in making data visualisation easier and faster. 

We have an in-built feature of DocArray that allows the users to visualise their data. Adding to this, users can also manipulate their data in any way they want. The main motivation behind this project is to showcase DocArray‚Äôs visualisation capabilities quickly and give users a hands-on experience.

We want to make use of front-end frameworks to bring DocArray‚Äôs capabilities in the browser. The idea is to implement DocArray‚Äôs visualisation feature in the browser so that with just a few clicks , users are able to see and interpret their data. The backend would be based on DocArray and solely written in Python while for the front-end, any framework can be used.

Additional functionalities would be welcomed but they are not a necessity. These additional functionalities will be catering to implementing different DocArray functions in the browser like creating a DocArray, matching nearest neighbours, embedding, etc.
An example of data visualisation can be seen [here](https://docarray.jina.ai/_images/embedding-projector-empty.gif).

#### Getting started:
Please introduce yourself in `#introductions` channel in our slack channel and learn about DocArray by reading the [documentation](https://docarray.jina.ai/). 


### *Project idea 4- Build Hub Executors for Jina Hub*

| Involves | Jina , Jina Hub|
| --- | --- |
| Skills needed | Python, Unit Testing, ConvNet |
| Project size | Large |
| Difficulty | Hard |
| Mentors | |

#### Project description

Jina Hub is an open source marketplace for [Executors](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/). As AI gets smarter, researchers have been trying to make accurate AI models and better search engines. The ability of AI to recognize data is extending and now spans over image data too. 
Specifically, with this project we are focusing on improving the user experience for search engines that use image classification. [This](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) brilliant research paper explains in depth how visual transformers are a good aid in image classification but they face problems in object detection and semantic segmentation. 

The result of this paper was the birth of ConvNeXt which scales better than Transformers in terms of accuracy and stability. Since this innovation is an improved ConvNet and will help AI researchers around the world, we want to make ConvNeXt-enabled Executor possible for Jina so that the task of image classification becomes easier, more accurate and more user friendly. 

This project is well suited for people who are interested in AI and have experience working with neural networks. The project involves a good amount of researching and reading of research papers based on ConvNet models. Jina Hub being purely open source, this will pave the way for developers to use the power of ConvNeXt for building accurate image classification systems.


#### Getting started:

Please introduce yourself in `#introductions` channel in our slack and learn about [Jina](https://docs.jina.ai/) and [Jina Hub](https://hub.jina.ai/). The project involves creation of executors, so try to make yourself familiar with Executors in depth.


### *Project idea 5 - 3D search application - Build and Finetune*

| Involves | Finetuner |
| --- | --- |
| Skills needed | Python, Unit Testing, ConvNet |
| Project size | Large |
| Difficulty | Hard |
| Mentors | |

#### Project description

3D mesh is a structural build of a 3D model consisting of polygons. The data type is used in a variety of places but it is not always easy to create a search system catering to only the 3D mesh data types. For this project, we have narrowed down our use case to a 3D printer. 

The project will be an open source search app where users will be able to find 3D models similar to the ones they input. 

The features for the project will be built in 3 steps:
- Support: The user enters the 3D file as a query. The matching here becomes simple search
- Feature (required): Image as a query. The challenge would be to take a 2D input and render 3d models as output.
- Feature (optional) : Text as a query. The challenge here will be to take the input as text and render 3d models related to it.


#### Getting started:

A good starting point would be introducing yourself in the `#introductions` channel on our slack and then, learning about [Jina](https://docs.jina.ai/). If you are already familiar with Jina, please look into working with [3D mesh](https://docarray.jina.ai/datatypes/mesh/) with Jina.
